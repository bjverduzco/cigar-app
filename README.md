# cigar-app

Prime Digital Academy Solo Project

Deployed via heroku with bug's minor bugs yet to be fixed at: https://pacific-falls-56537.herokuapp.com/

The application being created allows users to keep track of which cigars they currently own.
The application will also provide the personal ratings and feelings of the user in order to
make future purchases and enjoyment of cigars easier. Additional functionality allows a user
to monitor their humidor’s temperature and humidity through wifi capable hygrometers.

The application will be created with ease of use as a major goal. The ability to add ratings
or cigars to the user’s database from a mobile device is important. The realization that a
computer is not always readily available for a user is apparent. However, the numerous options
for rating or adding cigars cannot easily be viewed from a smaller mobile device. This will
allow a user to input the important information on the move, while still being able to input
complete information at their leisure.


--------------------------
Upon visiting the site, the login/registration page will be the first page that is seen. The ability to either login or register the user with their input data will be differentiated with the click of the buttons with their respective names.

After logging in the user will see the splash/personal humidor page. The page will display the list of cigars and their basic information. Additional information will be seen with the click of a button, bringing up the page with all of the advanced information displayed.

The add a cigar page will show up with the basic form of cigar info. The user will be required to enter these fields before being able to save the cigar to their personal humidor. There are additional fields available with the more options button. All of the additional information input fields are optional. They will only be displayed when the user chooses to do so.

The ratings list page will have the list of ratings that the user has previously entered. Again additional information will be seen with the click of the button. The extra information will again be displayed in the same way as the additional information from the personal humidor page.

On the rate a cigar page the user will be shown the basic form for rating a cigar. Again, as
with the add a cigar page, the user will have additional options available to them. These are optional and must not be filled out, but can be seen when the user chooses to.

The hygrometer list page will display the hygrometers that are linked to the application. The ability to feature a specific hygrometer on the header can be changed from this page with the radial button in the row of the specific hygrometer.

On the add a hygrometer page, the user will be prompted with specific input fields in order to link the wifi based hygrometer. The option to feature the added hygrometer on the header of the application can be achieved with the click of the radial button.
